#### Demo Web App (CollectionSpace + React + Material Design)

Creating a single page, mobile friendly, application using Facebook's 
Javascript library, [**React.js**](https://facebook.github.io/react/), 
and Google's [**Material Design Lite**](https://getmdl.io/). I provide content using the [**CollectionSpace API**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cspace-api) 
and one of the many [**CollectionSpace demo servers**](http://www.collectionspace.org/demo/).  

The only functional 'pages' are Home and Collection. 
Everything else is just a dummy, but can easily be built upon using existing React components. 
Feel free to use what I've created here as your own.

This app was built using the [**React Static Boilerplate**](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-static-boilerplate).
